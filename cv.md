## About Me

I completed a M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science and remained to work at the university. Now I am creating online products (online courses, interactive simulators, video lectures, longreads, etc.) for university educational programs.

At my current job I use my IT skills, but this is not my main task.
For example, it was necessary to change the timing in subtitles for 50 videos. I decided to write a script in Python that will move the timing forward by 10 seconds. This saved time.
In another project I used JavaScript. Using a Java script, I wrote complex logic in Adobe for 4 interactive simulators.

Now I’ve decided for myself that I want to engage in development full-time, and not in addition to my current work.

I believe that my organizational skills and basic IT skills will help me become an experienced front-end developer.
